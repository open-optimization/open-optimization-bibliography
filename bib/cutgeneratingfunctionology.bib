                  linear optimization problems. However, almost all
                  the functions proposed in the literature are defined
                  only for positive arguments, which restricts
                  considerably their applicability. The

                  issues. We explore these functions in depth with a
                  focus on maximal functions, i.e. the family of
                  non-dominated functions. The knowledge of these

                  general maximal dual-feasible functions that might
                  lead to strong cuts for integer linear optimization

                  x - \min_{x \in L} \pi^T x = w$ for some facet
                  $\pi^T x \leq \pi_0$ of L. The set obtained by
                  adding all cuts whose validity follows from a
                  maximal lattice free polyhedron with max-facet-width
                  at most w is called the wth split closure. We show
                  the wth split closure is a polyhedron. This
                  generalizes a previous result showing this to be
                  true when w = 1. We also consider the design of
                  finite cutting plane proofs for the validity of an
                  inequality. Given a measure of "size" of a maximal
                  lattice free polyhedron, a natural question is how
                  large a size s* of a maximal lattice free polyhedron
                  is required to design a finite cutting plane proof
                  for the validity of an inequality. We characterize
                  s* based on the faces of the linear relaxation of
                  the mixed integer linear set.},

                  model with a single row. Valid inequalities for this
                  model are expressed by valid functions and it has
                  been recently shown that any valid function is
                  dominated by some nonnegative valid function, modulo
                  the affine hull of the model. Within the set of
                  nonnegative valid functions, extreme functions are
                  the ones that cannot be expressed as convex
                  combinations of two distinct valid functions. In
                  this paper we construct an extreme function {$pi:

                  introduced by Gomory and Johnson to provide a
                  general framework for the theory of cutting planes:
                  the so-called valid functions, and in particular the
                  minimal and extreme functions, can be seen as
                  automatic rules for the generation of cuts. However,
                  while many extreme functions are piecewise linear
                  and therefore easy to describe, the set of extreme
                  functions turns out to have a very complicated
                  mathematical structure, as several extreme functions
                  are known that exhibit a somewhat pathological
                  behavior. In this paper we show that if some
                  smoothness assumption is imposed on an extreme
                  function {$\pi$}, then {$\pi$} is necessarily
                  piecewise linear. More precisely, we show that if a
                  continuous extreme function for the Gomory--Johnson
                  one-dimensional infinite group relaxation is a
                  piecewise {$\mathcal C$^2} function, then it is a
                  piecewise linear function.",

                  nowadays an integral part of all general purpose
                  software to solve MIP. The most prominent,and
                  computationally significant, class of general
                  cutting planes are Gomory mixed integer cuts
                  (GMI). However finding other classes of general cuts
                  for MIP that work well in practice has been
                  elusive. Recent advances on the understanding of
                  valid inequalities derived from the infinite
                  relaxation introduced by Gomory and Johnson for
                  mixed integer problems, has opened a new possibility
                  of finding such an extension. In this paper, we
                  investigate the computational impact of using a
                  subclass of minimal valid inequalities from the
                  infinite relaxation, using different number of
                  tableau rows simultaneously, based on a simple
                  separation procedure. We test these ideas on a set
                  of MIPs, including MIPLIB 3.0 and MIPLIB 2003, and
                  show that they can improve MIP performance even when

                  central role in the development of strong cutting
                  planes for mixed-integer programs. In this paper, we
                  investigate how known MIR inequalities can be
                  combined in order to generate new strong valid
                  inequalities. Given a mixed-integer
                  region S and a collection of valid ``base''
                  mixed-integer inequalities, we develop a procedure
                  for generating new valid inequalities for S. The
                  starting point of our procedure is to consider the
                  MIR inequalities related with the base
                  inequalities. For any subset of these MIR
                  inequalities, we generate two new inequalities by
                  combining or ``mixing'' them. We show that the new
                  inequalities are strong in the sense that they fully
                  describe the convex hull of a special mixed-integer
                  region associated with the base
                  inequalities. We discuss how the
                  mixing procedure can be used to obtain new classes
                  of strong valid inequalities for various
                  mixed-integer programming problems. In particular,
                  we present examples for production planning,
                  capacitated facility location, capacitated network
                  design, and multiple knapsack problems. We also
                  present preliminary computational results using the
                  mixing procedure to tighten the formulation of some
                  difficult integer programs. Finally we study some

                  integer programs for which a single cutting plane

                  these cuts are competitive with Gomory mixed-integer
                  cuts is very sensitive to the experimental setup. In
                  particular, we consider the issue of reliability

                  issue that is usually not addressed in the

                  cuts within a branch-and-cut framework. It has been
                  argued in the literature that ``a marriage of
                  classical cutting planes and tree search is out of
                  the question as far as the solution of large-scale
                  combinatorial optimization problems is concerned''
                  [16] because the cuts generated at one node of the
                  search tree need not be valid at other nodes. We
                  show that it is possible, by using a simple lifting
                  procedure, to make Gomory cuts generated at a node
                  of the enumeration tree globally valid in the case
                  of mixed 0--1 programs. The procedure essentially
                  amounts to treating the variables fixed at 0 or 1 as
                  if they were free. We also show why this lifting
                  procedure is not valid for general (other than 0--1)
                  mixed integer programs. Other issues addressed in
                  the paper are of a computational nature, such as
                  strategies for generating the cutting planes,
                  deciding between branching and cutting, etc. The
                  result is a robust mixed integer program solver.",

                  extreme valid functions for the k-dimensional
                  infinite group problem. In particular, we present
                  the general regular solution to Cauchy's additive
                  functional equation on restricted lower-dimensional
                  convex domains. This provides a k-dimensional
                  generalization of the so-called Interval Lemma,
                  allowing us to deduce affine properties of the
                  function from certain additivity relations. Next, we
                  study the discrete geometry of additivity domains of
                  piecewise linear functions, providing a framework
                  for finite tests of minimality and extremality. We
                  then give a theory of non-extremality certificates
                  in the form of perturbation functions. We apply
                  these tools in the context of minimal valid
                  functions for the two-dimensional infinite group
                  problem that are piecewise linear on a standard
                  triangulation of the plane, under a regularity
                  condition called diagonal constrainedness. We show
                  that the extremality of a minimal valid function is
                  equivalent to the extremality of its restriction to
                  a certain finite two-dimensional group problem. This
                  gives an algorithm for testing the extremality of a
                  given minimal valid function.",

                  two parts. In the first we present lifting in a very
                  general way, emphasizing superadditive lifting which
                  allows one to lift simultaneously different sets of

                  generating strong valid inequalities consists of
                  reduction to a knapsack set with a single continuous
                  variable, construction of a mixed integer rounding
                  inequality, and superadditive lifting. It is applied
