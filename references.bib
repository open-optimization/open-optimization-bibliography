    abstract = { (This article originally appeared in Management Science, January 1981, Volume 27, Number 1, pp. 1?18, published by The Institute of Management Sciences.) One of the most computationally useful ideas of the 1970s is the observation that many hard integer programming problems can be viewed as easy problems complicated by a relatively small set of side constraints. Dualizing the side constraints produces a Lagrangian problem that is easy to solve and whose optimal value is a lower bound (for minimization problems) on the optimal value of the original problem. The Lagrangian problem can thus be used in place of a linear programming relaxation to provide bounds in a branch and bound algorithm. This approach has led to dramatically improved algorithms for a number of important problems in the areas of routing, location, scheduling, assignment and set covering. This paper is a review of Lagrangian relaxation based on what has been learned in the last decade. }

TITLE = {An Efficient Mixed Integer Linear Programming Model for the Minimum Spanning Tree Problem},

ABSTRACT = {Finding a minimum spanning tree in a given network is a famous combinatorial optimization problem that appears in different engineering applications. Even though this problem is solvable in polynomial time, having efficient mathematical programming models is important as they can provide insights for formulating larger models that integrate other decisions in more complex applications. In the literature, there are ten different integer and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) models for this problem. They are variants of set packing, cuts, network flow and node level formulations. In addition, this paper introduces an efficient node level MILP model. Comparisons for the eleven models are provided. First, the models are compared in terms of the number of decision variables and the number of constraints. Then, computational comparisons using a commercial MILP solver on sets of randomly generated instances of different sizes are conducted. Results provide evidence that the proposed MILP model is competitive in terms of the computational time needed for proving optimality of generated solutions for instances with up to 50 nodes. Meanwhile, the LP relaxation of a multi-commodity flow MILP model which has integer polyhedron provides stable computational times despite its larger size.},

    abstract = { The cutting-stock problem is the problem of filling an order at minimum cost for specified numbers of lengths of material to be cut from given stock lengths of given cost. When expressed as an integer programming problem the large number of variables involved generally makes computation infeasible. This same difficulty persists when only an approximate solution is being sought by linear programming. In this paper, a technique is described for overcoming the difficulty in the linear programming formulation of the problem. The technique enables one to compute always with a matrix which has no more columns than it has rows. }

This heuristic achieves amazingly good results on ``real world'' Euclidean instances both with respect to running time and approximation ratio. There are numerous experimental studies on the performance of 2-Opt. However, the theoretical knowledge about this heuristic is still very limited. Not even its worst case running time on 2-dimensional Euclidean instances was known so far. We clarify this issue by presenting, for every {\$}p{\backslash}in{\backslash}mathbb{\{}N{\}}{\$}, a family of $L_p$ instances on which 2-Opt can take an exponential number of steps.",

However, almost all the functions proposed in the literature are defined only for positive arguments, which restricts considerably their applicability. The characteristics and properties of dual-feasible functions with general domains remain mostly unknown. In this paper, we show that extending these functions to negative arguments raises many issues. We explore these functions in depth with a focus on maximal functions, i.e. the family of non-dominated functions. The knowledge of these properties is fundamental to derive good families of general maximal dual-feasible functions that might lead to strong cuts for integer linear optimization problems and strong lower bounds for combinatorial optimization problems with knapsack constraints.",

                  continuous functions suffice to describe finite
                  dimensional corner polyhedra with rational data. We
                  also discover new facts about corner polyhedra with

    abstract = { Fast computation of valid linear programming (LP) bounds serves as an important subroutine for solving mixed-integer programming problems exactly. We introduce a new method for computing valid LP bounds designed for this application. The algorithm corrects approximate LP dual solutions to be exactly feasible, giving a valid bound. Solutions are repaired by performing a projection and a shift to ensure all constraints are satisfied; bound computations are accelerated by reusing structural information through the branch-and-bound tree. We demonstrate this method to be widely applicable and faster than solving a sequence of exact LPs. Several variations of the algorithm are described and computationally evaluated in an exact branch-and-bound algorithm within the mixed-integer programming framework SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programming). }

abstract="We present an exact rational solver for mixed-integer linear programming that avoids the numerical inaccuracies inherent in the floating-point computations used by existing software. This allows the solver to be used for establishing theoretical results and in applications where correct solutions are critical due to legal and financial consequences. Our solver is a hybrid symbolic/numeric implementation of LP-based branch-and-bound, using numerically-safe methods for all binding computations in the search tree. Computing provably accurate solutions by dynamically choosing the fastest of several safe dual bounding methods depending on the structure of the instance, our exact solver is only moderately slower than an inexact floating-point branch-and-bound solver. The software is incorporated into the SCIP optimization framework, using the exact LP  solver QSopt{\_}ex and the GMP arithmetic library. Computational results are presented for a suite of test instances taken from the Miplib and Mittelmann libraries and for a new collection of numerically difficult instances.",

	Abstract = {In this paper, we derive new families of facet-defining inequalities for the finite group problem and extreme inequalities for the infinite group problem using approximate lifting. The new valid inequalities for the finite group problem include two- and three-slope facet-defining inequalities as well as the first family of four-slope facet-defining inequalities. The new valid inequalities for the infinite group problem include families of two- and three-slope extreme inequalities. These new inequalities not only illustrate the diversity of strong inequalities for the finite and infinite group problems, but also provide a large variety of new cutting planes for solving integer and mixed-integer programming problems. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {Since its inception as a student project in 2001, initially just for the handling (as the name implies) of convex polyhedra, the Parma Polyhedra Library has been continuously improved and extended by joining scrupulous research on the theoretical foundations of (possibly non-convex) numerical abstractions to a total adherence to the best available practices in software development. Even though it is still not fully mature and functionally complete, the Parma Polyhedra Library already offers a combination of functionality, reliability, usability and performance that is not matched by similar, freely available libraries. In this paper, we present the main features of the current version of the library, emphasizing those that distinguish it from other similar libraries and those that are important for applications in the field of analysis and verification of hardware and software systems. },

                  the general regular solution to Cauchy's additive
                  functional equation on restricted lower-dimensional
                  convex domains. This provides a k-dimensional
                  generalization of the so-called Interval Lemma,
                  allowing us to deduce affine properties of the
                  function from certain additivity relations. Next, we
                  study the discrete geometry of additivity domains of
                  piecewise linear functions, providing a framework
                  for finite tests of minimality and extremality. We
                  then give a theory of non-extremality certificates
                  in the form of perturbation functions. We apply
                  these tools in the context of minimal valid
                  functions for the two-dimensional infinite group
                  problem that are piecewise linear on a standard
                  triangulation of the plane, under a regularity
                  condition called diagonal constrainedness. We show
                  that the extremality of a minimal valid function is
                  equivalent to the extremality of its restriction to
                  a certain finite two-dimensional group problem. This
                  gives an algorithm for testing the extremality of a
                  given minimal valid function.",

                  procedure combining mixed integer rounding with

                  integer programs. The survey contains essentially
                  two parts. In the first we present lifting in a very
                  general way, emphasizing superadditive lifting which
                  allows one to lift simultaneously different sets of
                  variables. In the second, our procedure for
                  generating strong valid inequalities consists of
                  reduction to a knapsack set with a single continuous
                  variable, construction of a mixed integer rounding
                  inequality, and superadditive lifting. It is applied

                  the set of all phylogenetic trees having a fixed set
                  of leaves. This space has a natural metric of
                  nonpositive curvature, giving a way of measuring
                  distance between phylogenetic trees and providing
                  some procedures for averaging or combining several
                  trees whose leaves are identical. This geometry also
                  shows which trees appear within a fixed distance of
                  a given tree and enables construction of convex
                  hulls of a set of trees. This geometric model of
                  tree space provides a setting in which questions
                  that have been posed by biologists and statisticians
                  over the last decade can be approached in a
                  systematic fashion. For example, it provides a
                  justification for disregarding portions of a
                  collection of trees that agree, thus simplifying the
                  space in which comparisons are to be made."

                  description of a convex optimization problem family,
                  and automatically generates custom C code that
                  compiles into a reliable, high speed solver for the
                  problem family. The current implementation targets
                  problem families that can be transformed, using
                  disciplined convex programming techniques, to convex
                  quadratic programs of modest size. CVXGEN generates
                  simple, flat, library-free code suitable for
                  embedding in real-time applications. The generated
                  code is almost branch free, and so has highly
                  predictable run-time behavior. The combination of
                  regularization (both static and dynamic) and
                  iterative refinement in the search direction
                  computation yields reliable performance, even with
                  poor quality data. In this paper we describe how
                  CVXGEN is implemented, and give some results on the
                  speed and reliability of the automatically generated
